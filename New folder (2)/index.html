    <p>At the age of eighteen, Guru Nanak Sahib Ji, was sent by his father Mehta Kalu to the city to do business. His father was disappointed that Guru Sahib mind was not into farming and other worldly work, therefore, he thought perhaps engaging him in trade would firstly, be a good profitable profession, and secondly his son would be happy all day talking to his clients about his business.

     Thinking this way and choosing an auspicious day, Mehta Kalu called Bhai Mardana Ji to accompany Guru Sahib.
     
     Mehta Kalu gave twenty rupees to Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana Ji and said, go with Nanak. Buy and bring some genuine goods by selling of which we may make profit. In this way if you make a profitable transaction, next time I will send you with more money to buy goods."
     
     Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana Ji started from Talwandi towards Choohar-khaana to purchase some merchandise. They had hardly gone ten or twelve miles from the village when they came across a village, where the people were starving, thirsty and sick due to lack of water and an outbreak of disease.
     
     Guru Nanak Sahib Ji said to Bhai Mardana Ji, fathetr has asked us to carry out some profitable transaction. No bargain can be more truly profitable than to feed and clothe the needy. I cannot leave this true bargain. It is seldom that we get an opportunity to carry out some profitable transaction like this.
     
     Guru Nanak took all the money to the next nearest village dwelling, where he bought plentiful supply of food and brought water for these people. Guru Sahib invested the twenty rupees into what we today call langar
     
     eis bhaekh ai thhaavahu gireho bhal aa jithhahu ko varas aae ||
     instead wearing these beggar robes, it is better to be a householder, and give to others (Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 587)
     
     As well as bringing food and water to the villagers, Bhai Mardana Ji and Guru Sahib brought clothes for with the money that was left. Taking leave from the villagers, they started back empty handed
     
     When both reached near Talwandi, Guru Nanak said to Mardana Ji, you go to the village alone, I shall sit at this well. Bhai Mardana Ji went to the village and narrated the whole story to Pita Mehta Kalu Ji. He told him where Guru Nanak was sitting. Mehta Kalu was very angry that they had wasted money on feeding, clothing and taking care of needy people and didn make any profit. Putting aside all work he took Bhai Mardana Ji along and started towards the well.
     
     Guru Nanak asked his father not to get angry with him. He tried to convince his father by telling that he had not done anything wrong with the money but has done a sacha Sauda (True bargain) in the true sense.For Mehta Kalu, amassing of wealth was the only true bargain because in this world it is money which is the mark of nobility, it is the wealthy who is wise, only the rich are considered gentle, honest, pious and lovers of mankind. The means by which the money has been earned are of no consideration. Only those who make true transaction think about the ways and means.

     At the place where the true bargain took place, Gurdwara Sacha Sauda Sahib is built. In current day Pakistan the Gurdwara Sacha Sauda is in the city of Farooqabad.
     
     Doing good to the people is the way of a Sikh. Sharing with the needy, makes the day of a Sikh. The true bargain of life is sharing one earning with the needy and helping in whatever way we can.
     
     There are other Sacha Sauda stories of Guru Nanak feeding hungry Sadhus. However, we must consider whether Guru Nanak would have served sadhu or starving villagers, taking into account the discussions with the siddhas, that Guru Nanak was not in favour of his own son lifestyle as a udasi sadhu and made Bhai Lehna the second guru, Sri Guru Angad Sahib Ji. Twenty rupees was a lot of money in those days, enough to help a whole village and much more than what would be required for a few sadhus.
     
     At the place where the true bargain took place, Gurdwara Sacha Sauda Sahib is built. In current day Pakistan the Gurdwara Sacha Sauda is in the city of Farooqabad. On Guru Nanak Sahib Ji gurpurb local muslim residents were interviewed in Farooqabad. An elderly Muslim man narrated the story of Guru Nanak Sahib true bargain. The stories shared by the muslim residents did not correlate with stories of Guru Nanak feeding hungry Sadhus.
     
     An elderly Muslim man described the story as it is written in the article. Guru Sahib fed starving and sick villagers, not reclusive, wandering Sadhus. He thanked Guru Sahib for saving his ancestors from sickness and coming to their aid.
     
     This is the foundation of Guru-Ka-Langar. Twenty rupees invested by Guru Nanak has led to Sikhs all over the world doing sewa of the needy, poor, sick and living the message of living in a household while sharing with others, as instructed by Guru Amar Das Ji.

    <p>In the year 1487, Guru Nanak Dev ji was married to Mata Sulakhni ji, and they had two sons, Sri Chand and Lakhmi Das. The family, accompanied by Bhai Mardana, a Muslim childhood friend of Guru Nanak Dev ji, then moved to the town of Sultanpur Lodhi, where Guru ji took the job of an accountant in charge of the stores of the local Governor. Here, Guru Nanak ji worked during the days, but during the early mornings and late nights, he meditated and sang hymns accompanied by Bhai Mardana on the rabab (a stringed instrument). During one of those early mornings while bathing in ‚ÄúVain Nadi‚Äù (a small river), Guru Nanak ji heard God‚Äòs call to dedicate himself completely to the service of humanity. The very first sentence which he uttered then was, "There is no Hindu, no Musalman (Muslim)". Stating that he had been taken to the God's court and given a divine mission, Guru Nanak ji then began the next stage of his life, to preach his unique doctrine (Sikhi) to the entire world</p>
    <h2>The Udasis Of Guru Nanak</h2>
    
     <p>Guru Nanak was moved by the plight of the people of world and wanted to tell them about the real message of God The peoples of the world were confused by the conflicting message given by priests, pundits, qazis, mullahs, etc. He was determined to bring his message to the masses; so in 1499, he decided to set out on his sacred mission to spread the holy message of peace and compassion to all of mankind.

        It is believed that Guru Nanak is the the second most travelled person in the world; most of his journeys were made on foot with his companion Bhai Mardana. He travelled in all four directions - North, East, West and South. The founder Sikh Guru is believed to have travelled more than 28,000 Kms in five major tours of the world during the period from 1500 to 1524. The record for the most travelled person is held by Ibn Battuta of Morocco.
        
        Guru Nanak saw the world suffering out of hatred, fanaticism, falsehood and hypocrisy. The world had sunk in wickedness and sin. So he decided that he had to travel and educate and press home the message of Almighty Lord. So he set out in 1499 on his mission for the regeneration of humanity on this earth. He carried the torch of truth, heavenly love, peace and joy for mankind. For 1 year he spread his message of peace, compassion, righteousness and truth to the people in and around his home</p>
